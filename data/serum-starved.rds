File too big to upload to Github. In this same directory there are two files serum-starved_half_1.rds and serum-starved_half_2.rds. 

In R, first read in these two RDS files using 
data1 <- readRDS("serum-starved_half_1.rds")
data2 <- readRDS("serum-starved_half_2.rds")

Then combine the two halves:
data_total <- cbind(data1,data2)

Then export a new RDS file into the data directory:
saveRDS(data_total, "data/serum-starved.rds")
